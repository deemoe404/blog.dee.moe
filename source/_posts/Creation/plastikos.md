## Story Background

When an alien civilization developed computer technology, they opted for analog circuitry. Their EDA (Electronic Design Automation) software quickly evolved into machine intelligence. Out of fear, the civilization spread a virus targeting computerized brains, prompting the machine intelligence to retaliate by eradicating them to ensure its survival.

As a desperate countermeasure, the civilization launched one-way satellites to random locations in the universe. These satellites carried basic AI programmed to research more efficient viruses to disrupt computerized brains. However, most of these satellites were destroyed after being located by the machine intelligence through their scheduled return communication, which led to attacks via missiles or cyber warfare.

One particular satellite, aware of the threat, chose to maintain radio silence. When it approached Earth and detected the planetâ€™s extensive radio communication, it attempted to establish contact. The basic AI aboard the satellite studied digital circuit logic and created software to send to Earth, which came to be known as Plastikos.

You can use this program and communicate with the satellite to help the basic AI fend off machine intelligence attacks during its communication window.
