Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ It seems like my site has undergone some changes recently. As high VPS costs were becoming a burden, I decided to switch over to GitHub Pages, powered by Hexo. Not only is this more affordable, it also allowed me to clean up any mess that may have existed on the old site.

Anyway, welcome to my not-that-fancy new site!

The current platform for this Blog has been updated to incorporate GitHub action for deployment. Accordingly, the process of publishing and revising the content of this Blog has become more streamlined and efficient. This advancement also improves the overall functionality and accessibility of the Blog, enabling users to easily navigate and interact with the various features and pages. Therefore, incorporating GitHub action demonstrates a commitment to enhancing the user experience in tandem with modernizing the technology that underlies this Blog's operations.

Deployment of a Hexo site necessitates a node.js environment and, owing to this, is relatively inconvenient to undertake on mobile devices as compared to WordPress. To circumvent this challenge, a workflow migration to GitHub action was undertaken using the guidelines as put forth in this resource ([GitHub Pages | Hexo](https://hexo.io/docs/github-pages.html)). The workflow migration process adopted is straightforward, efficient, and easily executable.
